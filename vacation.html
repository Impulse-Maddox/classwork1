My favorite vacation play is somewhere i can enjoy the nice view and air I've never really got to go anywhere i had to pick somewhere i have been i guess a beach i love watching the waves and taking a stroll at the boardwalk or anywhere with some i could call friends I'd enjoy that a lot the best part for me would be the ocean fresh air it could be an endless walk and i wouldn't mind it I don't know why but the sounds of the ocean and the warm breeze is really calming and relaxing for me
